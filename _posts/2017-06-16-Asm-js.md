## Applications

One can play a C++ game, run Qt applications (maybe JVM and .NET in future) in the browser with near
[native performance](# "original performance")!.

They've ported [Unreal Engine 3 to Asm.js](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/27/mozilla-is-unlocking-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/)

Imagine in the future you'll have ONLY browser icon on your monitor (if they survive till then :sweat_smile:) and you'll be running all applications through the browser! No installations required, and even run them through the smartphone!!

## What is it?

Javascript is an [interpreted language](# "reads code line by line at runtime > hence cannot detect errors beforehand, are slow due to runtime conversion into machine code") hence, slower than pre-compiled counterparts. Now what we're trying to achieve is run pre-compiled code in a browser, which will be faster.

[//DRAFT]: # (![abc](http://i.imgur.com/1yoy1Fa.png\)Emscripten takes in C/C++ code, passes it through LLVM, and converts the LLVM-generated bytecode into JavaScript (specifically, Asm.js, a subset of JavaScript\). Asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that is heavily restricted in what it can do and how it can operate. This is done so that the compiled Asm.js code can run as fast as possible making as few assumptions as it can, converting the Asm.js code directly into assembly.It’s important to note that Asm.js is just JavaScript – there is no special browser plugin or feature needed in order to make it work (although a browser that is able to detect and optimize Asm.js code will certainly run faster\). It effectively shaves off a whole bunch of things that can make a dynamic language, like JavaScript, slow: Like the need for garbage collection and dynamic types.)

[//TODO]: # (f = e | 0. When accessing and setting variables the results are consistently coerced into a specific type.)
[//TODO]: # ("use asm"; directive)
[//TODO]: # (ArrayBuffer)
